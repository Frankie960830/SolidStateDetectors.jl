# Detector Geometries

## Predefined Detectors

Currently, there are four predefined example detectors. 

Three of them are cylindrical detectors: Coaxial detector (Coax), Inverted coax detector (IVC) and a BEGe type detector (BEGe).
The fourth one is simple cube detector (CGD) in cartesian coordinates.

They are all specified in their JSON config files, which can be found under:
`<package_directory>/examples/example_detector_config_files/<config_filename>.json`.

### Example 1) Inverted Coax

Example minimum config file for an Inverted Coax detector (IVC) plus explanations.
**Remember**, comments are not allowed in JSON files and have to be deleted if you want to use it.
